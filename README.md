# reflectivityMLP

The primary task here is to predict the seismic reflectivity (i.e. the reflection coefficient) based on the impedance contrast across rock interfaces. The provided scripts use several well-log measurements including seismic P and S wave velocities as
well as rock density to determine reflectivity across layer boundaries. Seismic reflectivity describes the partitioning of seismic wave energy at an interface, typically a boundary between two different layers of rock. The reflection coefficient or reflectivity is the proportion of seismic wave amplitude reflected from an interface relative to the amplitude of the incoming wave. If 10% of the amplitude is returned, then the reflection coefficient is 0.10.

The data set for this exercise consists of 500 Vp, Vs, density and reflectivity measurements at different depths within a wellbore. The task is to predict the reflection coefficient for any new data set without knowing the incidence angle of the incoming wave and without any knowledge of the specific functional form that maps Vp, Vs and ùúö to reflectivity.
